# Introduction

This code is an implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in C# using Windows Forms. The Banker's Algorithm is a deadlock avoidance algorithm that is used to allocate resources to processes in a system. The code is divided into four classes: Form1, Entring_Max_Matrix, Allocated, Available, and Calc.

This code is made for my university assignment OS course in 2023.
 
Form1 is the main form of the application that allows the user to input the number of resources and processes.
Entring_Max_Matrix form allows the user to enter the maximum matrix values for each process.
Allocated form allows the user to enter the allocated matrix values for each process.
Available form allows the user to enter the available resources in the system.
Calc form implements the Banker's Algorithm to check for a safe sequence of processes that can be executed.
How to run the code
To run the code, you will need an IDE such as Visual Studio and .NET installed on your computer. Once you have installed the necessary tools, follow these steps:

- Clone the repository to your computer.
- Open the project in Visual Studio.
- Build the project and run it.

1. The application will start with Form1, which allows the user to enter the number of resources and processes. 
	
 2. The application will then move to the Entring_Max_Matrix form, where the user can enter the maximum matrix values for each process (entering all the values separated by space ). 
 
 3. After this, the application moves to the Allocated form, where the user can enter the allocated matrix values for each process (entering all the values separated by space ). 

 4.  Then, the application moves to the Available form, where the user can enter the available resources in the system (entering all the values separated by space ).
 
 5. Finally the application then uses the Banker's Algorithm to check for a safe sequence of processes that can be executed and displays the sequence on the Calc form.

Conclusion
This code provides a simple implementation of the Banker's Algorithm in C# using Windows Forms. It can be used as a starting point for further development or as a reference for understanding the Banker's Algorithm.
